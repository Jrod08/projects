                <p>And nothing was the same. With a handful of girls and they all so foreign. Quite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside. And you do dinners at French laundry and appa valley. 28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me. Some nights I wish I could go back in life. I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib,. What you bothering me for?. So get your ass in that car and come thru. I remember when it used to be music that did it. Depending on how you mix that shit. I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done. Fuck it I'm on one. Oh yeah. Walking through Edward security with your hat down, steady getting a pat down They just keep on saying that they feel you</p>
                <br><p>I've been faded too long ooh. Scallops and glasses indojay that shit right up your alley. A strong one. And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs. Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question. So girl, what you singing for?. The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive. I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it. Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?. We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on. They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down. 'Cause I'm on one. Yeah, it's been too long. for real. A whole lot of girls, first flight from Poland

When your famous girlfriend ass keep getting thicker than a plot does And when you forget her that's when she pop up. So I guess it's understandable man. Fuck it, I'm on one. Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice. There's a room full of niggas. I told 1da send me something and I got it covered. Oh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer. But you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of. I've been faded too long ooh. Oh yes, Oh yeah. Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one. When I should've went home. I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with. It gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual. I'm on one

I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh. Forget 3 SUV'S, for, distress like refugees. Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru. You need to act your age and not your girl's age. Take your nose off my keyboard. Yeah, oh you gotta love it. Money that we got, never get that shit. I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe. To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention. Been way too long. Girl you know we got thangs to do. All I care about is money and the city that I'm from. It's cause we blowing like a C4. Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me. We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past</p><br>

Its feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now. Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way. Somehow always rise above it. Yeah, I said I'm on one. I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with. But then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?. And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young. Prolly forever if I stay in my zone. It'll be a long time for y'all feel me, if ever. Oh yeah. You won't feel me til everybody says they love you but it's not love. Last night I went to sleep, wanted more<br>
